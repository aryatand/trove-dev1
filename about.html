            Besides being a very academically- and professionally-inclined institution, USC is also popularly known for the heavy emphasis on a social culture. The overall culture of USC is constantly encouraging students to prioritize both aspects (academics and social), and as a result, there is often a gray area between both. With the lines being blurred, USC students struggle with staying organized and setting their priorities straight. While this problem can be seen at USC, it is also quite prevalent within other college institutions across the country.
            </p><p>
            Staying organized is a big concern within the USC student population and students attending other colleges, so this website will provide resources and tips on how students can address this concern of theirs. Additionally, being USC students ourselves, we believe that we can identify resources that are most applicable to students at USC.
